When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I collaborate with other people. Also it will be useful when I work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it can happen that I don't need all changes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Clones - when you make a copy of repository from GitHub to your local computer.
Forks - when you make a copy of repository from somebody’s GitHub account to your GitHub account.
Branch - when you need to make changes in the same repository but to keep the main version (master) as it is.
I’ll choose one of these three depending on the task I need to do taking into account I wrote before about their functionality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
The benefit is that you will have an up-to-date copy in you local computer if you won't have an iternet access. And there is no need to merge it with your local repository if you don't want to do it right now.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
